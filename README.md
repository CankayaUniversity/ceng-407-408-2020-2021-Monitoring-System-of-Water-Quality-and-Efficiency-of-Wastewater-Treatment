## Installing and Running the Project

Each module folder contains specific instructions in their respective `README.md` files to run the software during development.
- For backend instructions, see [`source/backend/README.md`](https://github.com/CankayaUniversity/ceng-407-408-2020-2021-Monitoring-System-of-Water-Quality-and-Efficiency-of-Wastewater-Treatment/blob/main/source/backend/README.md)
- For frontend instructions, see [`source/frontend/README.md`](https://github.com/CankayaUniversity/ceng-407-408-2020-2021-Monitoring-System-of-Water-Quality-and-Efficiency-of-Wastewater-Treatment/blob/main/source/frontend/README.md)
- For data pipeline instructions, see [`source/data pipeline/README.md`](https://github.com/CankayaUniversity/ceng-407-408-2020-2021-Monitoring-System-of-Water-Quality-and-Efficiency-of-Wastewater-Treatment/blob/main/source/data%20pipeline/README.md)
- Other modules will be added soon.

Since we're planning to distribute the software as a single Docker Image, the instructions above are only needed during development.
