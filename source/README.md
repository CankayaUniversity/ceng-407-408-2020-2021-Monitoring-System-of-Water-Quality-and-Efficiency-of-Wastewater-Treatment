`app` folder contains files to build a Docker image.

`backend` folder contains the Django source code.

`frontend` folder contains the React front-end code.

`data pipeline` folder contains code for a bunch of different programs for reading raw data (Msft Access `.mdb` files, Excel `.xlsm` and `.xlsx` etc.) and generating `.csv` datasets from them to be used in both the backend and the ML modules.

Other folders will be added later.

Each folder includes a `README.md` file containing instructions on how to run the software.
